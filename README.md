# Swadhyaya Yoga Institute ‚Äì Website Case Study

üåê **Live Site**: [https://swadhyayayoga.in](https://swadhyayayoga.in)


## Project Overview

Swadhyaya Yoga Institute is a traditional yoga studio in Bangalore (India), offering therapeutic yoga for seniors and people seeking holistic healing. The studio needed a professional and accessible online presence to share class information, build credibility, and enable easy contact and appointment booking.


## My Role

I worked independently on every aspect of the project, including:

- Branding & visual identity  
- Website design & development (HTML, CSS, JS)  
- Content writing  
- Logo design, Photography & image editing  
- Domain, DNS & SSL configuration  
- Third-party integrations


## Goals & Design Approach

The studio‚Äôs primary clientele includes:

- Seniors  
- People recovering from injury or seeking pain relief  
- Individuals seeking authentic, holistic yoga therapy  

With this in mind, I prioritized a clean, minimal, and calming UI that is intuitive for all age groups. Key actions like calling, booking, and finding the studio are always one click away.
