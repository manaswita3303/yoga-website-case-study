# Swadhyaya Yoga Institute ‚Äì Website Case Study

üåê **Live Site**: [https://swadhyayayoga.in](https://swadhyayayoga.in)


## Project Overview

Swadhyaya Yoga Institute is a traditional yoga studio in Bangalore (India), offering therapeutic yoga for seniors and people seeking holistic healing. The studio needed a professional and accessible online presence to share class information, build credibility, and enable easy contact and appointment booking.


## My Role

I worked independently on every aspect of the project, including:

- Branding & visual identity  
- Website design & development (HTML, CSS, JS)  
- Content writing  
- Logo design, Photography & image editing  
- Domain, DNS & SSL configuration  
- Third-party integrations


## Goals & Design Approach

The studio‚Äôs primary clientele includes:

- Seniors  
- People recovering from injury or seeking pain relief  
- Individuals seeking authentic, holistic yoga therapy  

With this in mind, I prioritized a clean, minimal, and calming UI that is intuitive for all age groups. Key actions like calling, booking, and finding the studio are always one click away.

## Challenges & Solutions

### Hosting & DNS
The client was using GoDaddy, with incomplete setup. I handled the entire DNS integration, used Cloudflare for SSL, and ensured everything resolved securely.

### Responsiveness
I manually handled media queries and tested across devices to ensure mobile-first design for the target audience.

### One-Person Team
I managed all aspects‚Äîfrom design and content to technical setup and client communication. This gave me full creative control and also taught me how to manage scope effectively.


## Outcome

- Website is live and functional  
- Secure, fast, and mobile-friendly  
- Clear structure, user-friendly interface  
- Client outreach improved via direct contact tools


## Tools Used

## Next Steps
